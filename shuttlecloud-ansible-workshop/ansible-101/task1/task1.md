# Task1:

Ansible is agentless, the only thing you need to start trying Ansible is Ansible, and SSH access to the hosts you want to manage.

In this task, you have to achieve the next goals:

1. Start your [vagrant] (https://www.vagrantup.com/) machine defined in this folder
2. Check that you can access the machine with Ansible
3. Check the date and time of the machine
4. Get a list of the files in /root folder
