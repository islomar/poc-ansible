# Task1:

Ansible is agentless, the only thing you need to start trying Ansible is Ansible, and SSH access to the hosts you want to manage.

In this task, you have to achieve the next goals:

1. Start your [vagrant] (https://www.vagrantup.com/) machines defined in this folder
2. Check that you can access the machines with Ansible
3. Check the date and time of the machines
4. Get a list of the files in /root folder of one and then both of the machines
